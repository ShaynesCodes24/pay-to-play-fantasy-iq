# Fantasy IQ Paid Customer Deploy

White-label deploy package for a paid Fantasy IQ league dashboard. The first
release is a concierge setup product: customers pay, send their ESPN league
details, and you configure/deploy their dashboard manually.

Price model:

```text
$25 per league / year
```

Sales model:

```text
Concierge setup. No customer login or self-serve provisioning required for v1.
```

Website URL shape:

```text
https://<customer-project>.vercel.app/
```

Recommended Vercel project name:

```text
fantasyiq
```

If Vercel accepts that name, the live website URL will be:

```text
https://fantasyiq.vercel.app/
```

Paid dashboard URL shape:

```text
https://<customer-project>.vercel.app/FantasyIQ/
```

## Customer Promise

Use this positioning for the paid offer:

```text
Fantasy IQ gives your ESPN fantasy football league a custom draft command
center with live public-league draft sync, ranked boards, mock draft practice,
trade discipline, and league branding.
```

Recommended checkout/onboarding flow:

1. Customer pays $25/year.
2. Customer submits the intake form in `CUSTOMER_INTAKE.md`.
3. You confirm the ESPN league is public.
4. You configure and deploy one Vercel project for that customer.
5. You email the customer their dashboard link and renewal date.
